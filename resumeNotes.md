  - Built a minimal latency market data collection system in Go and an order management application in Python
  - Created data pipelines to collect and store terabytes of market data from edge servers to analysis servers
  - Constructed a unified UDP interface for arbitrary trading strategies to consume market data and manage orders on 12 cryptocurrency exchanges
  - Crafted GUI debugging tools to debug order placement with any exchange as if the user was a trading strategy
  - Implemented a GUI and query server for analyzing recorded market data
  - Wrote partitioning scripts for managing host folder structure and application contexts
  - Devised and wrote the deployment pipeline for python and go applications
  - Integrated DataDog and Slack alerting into Market Data and order execution applications

  At Uphold I am part of the team responsible for managing users assets in the company reserve on
  cryptocurrency exchanges.
  In my time here I have have owned several projects, mainly surrounding low latency
  connectivity to those exchanges and the analysis of data gathered from those connections.
  <br/>
  I constructed a unified UDP interfaces with Go and Python for arbitrary trading strategies to
  consume binary market data and manage orders on 12 cryptocurrency exchanges.
  Additionally, I wrote bash for data pipelines to collect terabytes of market data from edge
  servers and to move that data to analysis servers.
  For analysis and exploration, I created a React GUI and Go query server for analyzing
  the recorded market data.
  <br />
  To manage those servers running on Ubuntu servers, I wrote deployment and  partitioning scripts
  to create our environments in a standardized manner. I also created debugging tools and GUIs to allow
  developers to listen to data flowing between applications and mock connections for testing.
